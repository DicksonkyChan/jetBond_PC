# JetBond Progress Update - January 17, 2025

## Today's Accomplishments

### ✅ Comprehensive Logging System Implemented
- **Server Logging**: Added file logging to `jetbond.log` with timestamped entries
- **Frontend Logging**: Created `AppLogger` utility for Flutter app logging
- **Full Request Tracking**: All API calls, user actions, and errors now logged
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Can track user activity as it happens

### ✅ User ID System Fixed
- **Issue**: Flutter app was using hardcoded `'user-rikke'` instead of email
- **Solution**: Updated to use proper email addresses as user IDs
- **Result**: Now correctly uses `rikke@jetbond.com` (URL-encoded as `rikke%40jetbond.com`)

### ✅ Server Control Improvements
- Modified batch file to run server in current window instead of new window
- Logs now visible directly in terminal where server is started
- Better debugging and monitoring experience

## Current System Status

### Working Features
- ✅ User login/registration with email-based IDs
- ✅ Profile management (employee/employer modes)
- ✅ Job posting and listing
- ✅ Real-time job refresh (30-second intervals)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging (server + frontend)
- ✅ WebSocket connections for real-time features
- ✅ In-memory data storage with sample data

### Test Users Available
- **Employee**: `rikke@jetbond.com` / password: `1234`
- **Employer**: `dee@jetbond.com` / password: `1234`

## Technical Implementation

### Server Components
- `server-local.js` - Main API server with logging
- `jetbond.log` - Server activity log file
- In-memory storage for development/testing
- WebSocket support for real-time features

### Frontend Components
- Flutter mobile app with comprehensive logging
- `AppLogger` utility class for categorized logging
- Email-based authentication system
- Auto-refresh job listings

## Next Steps (Future Sessions)
1. Test job application workflow end-to-end
2. Implement real-time notifications via WebSocket
3. Add job matching algorithm improvements
4. Consider database persistence (DynamoDB integration)
5. Add more comprehensive error handling
6. Implement rating/review system

## Files Modified Today
- `server-local.js` - Added comprehensive logging
- `jetbond_mobile/lib/main.dart` - Fixed user IDs, added logging
- `jetbond_mobile/lib/utils/logger.dart` - New logging utility
- `jetbond_mobile/pubspec.yaml` - Added path_provider dependency
- `server-control.bat` - Modified to run in current window

## Log Evidence
System is actively logging user interactions:
- User profile updates from "Rikke Szeto"
- Auto-refresh job listings every 30 seconds
- Proper email-based user ID usage after fix
- All API requests with full headers and body data

The logging system is working perfectly and provides excellent visibility into system activity.
