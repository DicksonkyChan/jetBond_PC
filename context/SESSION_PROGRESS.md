# JetBond Session Progress - Job Application Fix

## 🔧 **Issues Fixed This Session**

### **1. Job Application Not Working**
- **Problem**: When employees clicked "Apply Now", nothing happened
- **Root Cause**: Mobile app wasn't calling the matching endpoint before applying
- **Solution**: Updated application flow to call `/jobs/:id/matches` first, then `/jobs/:id/respond`

### **2. Login System Implementation**
- **Problem**: No proper login system, users couldn't persist sessions
- **Solution**: Created simple email/password login with predefined accounts:
  - `rikke@jetbond.com` / `1234` (Employee)
  - `dee@jetbond.com` / `1234` (Employer)

### **3. Profile Updates Not Saving**
- **Problem**: Profile changes weren't persisted to server
- **Solution**: Added PUT `/users/:id` endpoint and updated mobile app to call it

### **4. User Experience Improvements**
- Added logout button to both dashboards
- Added user validation before job applications
- Added sample data for testing
- Improved error messages and feedback

## 🚀 **Current Status**

- ✅ Login with predefined accounts
- ✅ Job application flow (employee can apply to jobs)

### **🔄 Active Components**
