# JetBond Job Application Workflow

## Overview
Complete workflow for job applications from posting to completion, including cancellation handling.

## 1. Job Posting (Employer)
```

                   ‚Üí AI finds potential matches
                   ‚Üí WebSocket notifications sent to matched employees
```

## 2. Job Application (Employee)
```
Employee sees job ‚Üí Clicks "Apply Now" ‚Üí Server adds to job.matchingWindow.responses[]
                                      ‚Üí Employee status set to 'busy'
                                      ‚Üí Employee.currentJobId = jobId
                                      ‚Üí Button changes to "Cancel Application"
                                      ‚Üí WebSocket notification to employer
```

## 3. Application Cancellation (Employee)

                                      ‚Üí Adds to job.canceledApplications[]
                                      ‚Üí Employee status reset to 'open_to_work'
                                      ‚Üí Button changes to "Application Canceled"
                                      ‚Üí Employee CANNOT reapply to same job
                                      ‚Üí Employer no longer sees this applicant
```

## 4. Employee Selection (Employer)
```
Employer ‚Üí Views applicants ‚Üí Selects employee ‚Üí Job status = 'assigned'
                                               ‚Üí Selected employee stays 'busy'
                                               ‚Üí Other applicants reset to 'open_to_work'
                                               ‚Üí WebSocket notifications to all applicants
```

## 5. Job Completion by Employee
```
Employee ‚Üí Completes current job ‚Üí Rates employer ‚Üí Employer rating updated
                                                  ‚Üí Employee status = 'open_to_work'
                                                  ‚Üí Employee.currentJobId = null
```

## 6. Job Completion by Employer
```

                                         ‚Üí Employee rating updated

3. Canceled applicants are removed from employer's view

5. Only employers can complete jobs and rate employees
6. Employees can rate employers when completing work
7. Employee status and currentJobId are reset to 'open_to_work'/null on job completion
8. Both employer and employee ratings are tracked separately
9. Employees cannot cancel applications once job is assigned (status = 'assigned')
